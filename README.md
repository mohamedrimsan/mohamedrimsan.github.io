🌐 About My Website

My personal website is a showcase of my cybersecurity journey, projects, and professional insights. It’s designed to be fast, secure, and informative—just like the systems I protect.

This portfolio website is built entirely with the latest versions of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, showcasing my skills and projects in cybersecurity. It’s a static site—meaning there’s no backend—which makes it fast, lightweight, and secure.
I host it using GitHub Pages, a free and reliable platform that integrates seamlessly with GitHub for version control. Every update is managed through Git, either via command line or GitHub Desktop, keeping my workflow simple and efficient.

🔒 Security by Design

Since the site is static, it has a minimal attack surface. I follow best practices like:

- Using HTTPS for secure communication
- Writing clean, semantic code with accessibility in mind
- Avoiding unnecessary scripts or plugins that could introduce vulnerabilities

✨ Why This Stack?

I chose this setup because it’s:

- Easy to maintain and update
- Perfect for showcasing projects without server-side complexity
- Secure and fast-loading across all devices
