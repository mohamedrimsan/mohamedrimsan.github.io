        <h1>👨 About Me</h1>

        <p id="justify">
          I’m <strong>Mohamed Rimsan</strong>, a third-year BSc (Hons) in Information Technology undergraduate with a strong and growing interest in
          <strong>Cybersecurity (SOC operations) and IT operations</strong>.I have been building my expertise in defensive security through hands-on labs, 
          threat detection exercises, and incident response simulations, while also strengthening my foundation in systems, networking, and enterprise IT environments.
        </p>

        <p id="justify">
        My learning journey combines <strong>practical technical exposure</strong> with a <strong>problem-solving mindset</strong>. 
        I continuously enhance my skills through online courses, workshops, and hands-on projects in areas such as log analysis, digital forensics fundamentals, 
        and security monitoring. In parallel, I actively engage with professional communities and industry resources to stay aligned with evolving cybersecurity 
        and IT best practices.
        </p>

        <p id="justify">
          My prior experience in IT support, customer service, and data management has strengthened my
          <strong>troubleshooting</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>, <strong> documentation</strong>, and <strong>team collaboration</strong> skills —
          qualities essential for both IT operations and security-focused roles in fast-paced environments.
        </p>

        <p id="justify">
          I’m now seeking <strong>entry-level or internships opportunities </strong> in IT support or Security Operations environments where I can contribute 
          effectively, gain practical industry exposure, and progressively develop into a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.

      <!-- Education -->
       <h2 class=>👨🏻‍💻 My Educational Journey</h2>
      <div class="container section-title project-card">
        

        <p id="justify">
          My journey began with a natural curiosity about how technology works behind the scenes. 
          What started as an interest in science and computing gradually evolved into a focused passion 
          for <strong>Information Technology</strong> and, more recently, <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>.
        </p>

        <p id="justify">
          Currently, I am pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Information Technology (BSc Hons IT)</strong> at the <strong>The Open University of Sri Lanka</strong>.
          Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Information Technology (BSc Hons IT), where 
          I am developing a strong foundation in networking, systems administration, and IT infrastructure, alongside 
          growing expertise in defensive security principles. I have actively explored areas such as <strong>SOC operations, 
          incident response, and threat detection</strong> through hands-on labs, self-driven projects, and continuous technical learning.
        </p>

        <p id="justify">
          My academic journey goes beyond theoretical understanding—it is centered on applying knowledge in practical scenarios to build 
          real-world problem-solving capabilities. <strong>I am committed to strengthening both my IT and cybersecurity competencies to effectively 
          contribute in dynamic, security-conscious technology environments.</strong>
        </p>
